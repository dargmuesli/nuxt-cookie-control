A [**minimal reproduction**](https://stackblitz.com/github/dargmuesli/nuxt-cookie-control?file=playground%2Fapp.vue) is required unless you are absolutely sure that the issue is obvious and the provided information is enough to understand the problem. If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it will receive a "need reproduction" label. If no reproduction is provided we might close it.
